# Exam4_Python_JM

##Included in this repository is a python script, python test script, a data file, and output files.

This python script is a script used to read each line in a text file containing DNA sequences. There are three functions within the script, one to calculate possible combinations of strings, one to calculate observed combinations of strings, and linguistic complexity. The script outputs possible and observed combinations of strings for each line (i.e each DNA sequence) as a data frame. It also calculates linguistic complexity of each line of the text file and includes this value at the end of each data frame. More details about each function are included within the script itself.

##To run this script in python: python3 Exam_4_JM.py
In order to read in a file to this script, you must create a text file containing DNA sequences and name it listofstrings.txt
This script will create the outputs stated above for each line of the text file.

##To test this script in python: py.test Exam4_testsJM.py
